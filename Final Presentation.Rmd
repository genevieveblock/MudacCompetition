## Outline


## Problem 1

- The question

- Data source

- Data size

- Goal: prediction v inference; regression v clsasification

## The Data

- types of variables

- ranges

- etc.

## Results

- Final model

- Interpretations

- Conclusions (what specific policy should Minnesota look at implementing?)


## Data Cleaning



## Data Exploration


## Cross-Validation


## Variable Selection


## Model Analysis

- What do the statistics and visualizations tell you about the strength, efficacy, accuracy of your model?


## Summary

 - Tell the story again
 
 

## Problem 2

- The question

- Data source

- Data size

- Goal: prediction v inference; regression v clsasification

## The Data

- types of variables

- ranges

- etc.

## Results

- Final model

- Interpretations

- Conclusions (what specific policy should Minnesota look at implementing?)


## Data Cleaning



## Data Exploration



## Variable Selection



## Model Analysis

- What do the statistics and visualizations tell you about the strength, efficacy, accuracy of your model?

- We'll use lm(Index ~ TSS... to do this


## Summary

 - Tell the story again
 
 - Drive home how it ties into the overarching project
